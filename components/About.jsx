            <span className="text-orange text-lg">Hello again!</span> Thanks for
            making it this far! I graduated with a{" "}
            <span className="text-orange">Bachelor's in Mathematics</span> in
            2020, but soon after cultivated a love for coding. Fast forward to
            2022, and I decided to take some more programming classes while I
            worked as a teacher. Since then, I have been consistently learning
            and improving my skills to become a full-stack developer and to
            start a career in something that I am passionate about.

          <p className="font-secondary">
            When I am not coding, you can find me exploring the{" "}
            <span className="text-orange">outdoors</span> with my husband,
            trying to improve my <span className="text-orange">latte art</span>{" "}
            skills (they are non-existent at the moment, but I am determined!),
            playing a <span className="text-orange">game</span> on my Nintendo
            Switch, or enjoying a good <span className="text-orange">book</span>
            .
